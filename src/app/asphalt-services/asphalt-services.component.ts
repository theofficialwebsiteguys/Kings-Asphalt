          description: 'How many times have you come across a parking lot that was poorly designed? Or, found that there was no place to park? There’s a lost art to parking lot painting and roadway striping. With roads, clean and clear lines help to guide traffic. With parking lots, distinguished lines help ensure there’s adequate parking for all clients, customers, and employees. But, when parking lot lines fade, parking can be hazard and accidents can occur if people can’t see lines clearly. To help update space in your parking lot area, parking lot stripe maintenance is suggested. By applying a fresh coat of paint to lines, it can brighten your lot. Another reason to add new line striping is if you want to maximize space. You can allow for more traffic, especially in highly congested areas like shopping malls. Because first impressions matter, let Kings Highway help with your line painting needs. Protecting your investment includes regular maintenance in your parking lot or roadway. You’re letting others know that you care about all vehicle and pedestrian traffic. ',
